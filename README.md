# This is ChroMapper.
ChroMapper is an in-development, Unity-based map editor for Beat Saber, specializing in modded map creation.

ChroMapper will allow you to create stunning lightshows with Chroma RGB lighting, unique gameplay maps with ChromaToggle notes, powerful JSON editing with a built-in Node Editor, and more.

Because this is in a closed alpha state, no releases will be publically released until later in development.

# Closed Alpha?
ChroMapper is currently in closed alpha. This means that no public builds are available, and public videos of ChroMapper will be rare, if any. For development purposes, a select group of Chroma lightmappers are in the closed alpha team to hunt bugs and give suggestions. There are a few methods of which you can enter into ChroMapper closed alpha testing:
- DM me on Discord. I'll determine whether or not you can join ChroMapper testing by recommendations from the other fellow closed alpha testers. Unless you are a well known mapper, you most likely will not get in this way.
- [Support SkyKiwi and Chroma development on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/Chroma) The Pentachrome Sabers tier ($15+) will give you access to ChroMapper closed alpha testing as a bonus of supporting SkyKiwi, and future development for the Chroma suite.
- Cheat the system, clone the repository, and load it in Unity. This may not garauntee an up to date build as time goes on, but if you're really desparate for a ChroMapper build, here ya go. I wont help you with any issues though, since you *did* circumvent the closed alpha group.

Closed alpha means that not all features are in the mapper yet. **This is not currently meant to be a replacement for MediocreMapper or other mapping tools.** While this may be a viable mapping tool, features one might call a "necessity" might not be implemented yet.

If you wish to follow ChroMapper development, [here is the Trello board for ChroMapper.](https://trello.com/b/j2ikcHZh/chromapper-development) Here, you can figure out all that has been suggested by the closed alpha testing crew, what we are currently working on, and what has been done.

Once ChroMapper has reached a development point where most basic features are implemented, and more advanced features are in the works, I'll consider:
- Switching to Closed Beta, where a larger selection of people will be invited to test ChroMapper, however it wont be like Chroma's previous *"Closed Beta Testing"*.
- Switching to Open Beta, where anyone and everyone can download a ChroMapper build and try it out for themselves. While this will increase bug reporting and bug fixes, this will also invite people to continouly ask the same basic questions, a la BSMG #pc-mod-support.

# For Developers
ChroMapper is currently being developed using Unity 5.6.6f2. Before you bash me for using such an old Unity version, we currently plan on upgrading to at least Unity 2018.3.10f1 in the near future.

This GitHub repository should come with the assets and scripts you need to easily open it up in Unity. Feel free to fork the repository if you plan on contributing to ChroMapper in any way. Even though ChroMapper is in closed alpha, if you are able to clone or fork and get the project working on your end, I'll allow you to use it as long as you're making contributions to ChroMapper.

Don't like my coding job? Too bad. Unless you're feeling like rewriting it, the code will stick unless Kiwi and I have a reason to refactor/rework it again.

## Contributing
I'd recommend using the GitHub for Visual Studio extension for pushing changes to your fork of ChroMapper. 

GitHub for Unity does not appear to work for the version of Unity ChroMapper is using, so I've deleted it from the source. Once ChroMapper has updated to a more recent Unity version, then we'll reconsider using GitHub for Unity.
